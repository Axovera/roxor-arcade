 * CyberProtect - http://iase.disa.mil/eta/cyber-protect/launchpage.htm - "In the CyberProtect exercise, you are responsible for the security of a department LAN. Now your department has just converted to a new operating system. All other elements of the security "Rings of Protection" are in place and certified by your installation's commander for the level of information your department processes. Because your operating system is new, however, there is no network security in place until you put it there. Your LAN is vulnerable-you better get started!"
